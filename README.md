## Featured Build: Terminal Jarvis
One command center for AI coding tools with a consistent UX across Claude, Gemini, Qwen, and more.
- Distributed wherever developers work: npm, crates.io, and Homebrew.
- Ships with repeatable shortcuts so switching models stays frictionless.
- [Repository](https://github.com/BA-CalderonMorales/terminal-jarvis) · [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/terminal-jarvis) · [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/terminal-jarvis)

## Currently Exploring
Lightweight experiments that keep developer environments predictable and expressive.
- Coder templates for consistent dev environments.
- Terminal screensavers and TUI polish in Rust.
- Docs-as-code patterns for shipping fast without losing clarity.

## How I Work
Principles that keep the footprint lean while inviting collaboration.
- Ship one flagship, iterate in public, and keep the footprint lean.
- Documentation and code get the same testing and care.
- Build tools that invite collaboration.
