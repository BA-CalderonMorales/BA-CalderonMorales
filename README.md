### Featured Build: Terminal Jarvis
- Unified command center for AI coding tools; one consistent UX for Claude, Gemini, Qwen, and more.
- Distribution everywhere developers live: npm, crates.io, and Homebrew.
- [Repository](https://github.com/BA-CalderonMorales/terminal-jarvis) · [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/terminal-jarvis) · [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/terminal-jarvis)

### Currently Exploring (lightweight)
- Coder templates for consistent dev environments.
- Terminal screensavers and TUI polish in Rust.
- Docs-as-code patterns for shipping fast without losing clarity.

### Philosophy
- Ship one flagship, iterate in public, and keep the footprint lean.
- Documentation and code deserve the same level of testing and care.
