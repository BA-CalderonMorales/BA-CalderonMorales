<summary>Quick Intro</summary>

Once a U.S. Marine managing legal cases, I'm now a self-taught software engineer pursuing a computer science degree. I love turning messy problems into reliable systems and documenting what I learn along the way.

<summary>Engineering Philosophy</summary>

- Documentation deserves the same care as code. I version and test it like any other artifact.
- Modernizing legacy systems is a challenge I enjoy â€“ there's satisfaction in making old code new again.
- Code should deliver real value, so I approach problems with a product mindset.

<summary>Beyond the Keyboard</summary>

I'm bilingual (English/Spanish), a lifelong learner, and a fan of automating everyday tasks. You'll often find me experimenting with new tooling or helping teammates master their workflows.
