<p align="center"><em>Product-minded software engineer (4+ yrs) exploring agentic workflows and developer tooling.</em></p>

## Current Focus
Staying close to how AI reshapes day-to-day coding.
- Agentic workflows that feel practical, not theatrical.
- Safe dev environments for teams experimenting with AI assistants.
- Automation that earns its keep: docs generation, boilerplate, the mundane stuff.

## Featured: Terminal Jarvis
A single CLI for orchestrating 10+ AI coding tools.
- Ships via npm, crates.io, and Homebrew.
- Consistent shortcuts across Claude, Gemini, Qwen, and more.
- [Repository](https://github.com/BA-CalderonMorales/terminal-jarvis) · [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/terminal-jarvis) · [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/terminal-jarvis)

## How I Work
- One flagship, iterated in public.
- Docs treated like code.
- Tools that meet you where you are.
