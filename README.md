Currently exploring the world of open source on my free time while also working in the government sector doing government software engineering stuff.

Would like to collab on more open source things, depending on the value you feel ike I would bring to your team.

Current skillset:
- javascript
- git
- bash
- linux
- virtual machines
- gitlab-ci
- yaml

I'm a bit more knowledgeable with frontend tech, but I'm not afraid to dabble in all avenues of the software engineering discipline.

Hope to work with you soon!
