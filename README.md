<summary>Quick Intro</summary>

Once a U.S. Marine managing legal cases, I'm now a self-taught software engineer pursuing a computer science degree. I love turning messy problems into reliable systems and documenting what I learn along the way.

<summary>Experiments</summary>
<br />

Actively testing the actual might of every AI CLI, LLM, SLM, etc. against these three mock levacy repos.

If these still suck, it's because AI in general still is isn't quite there.

<summary>Engineering Philosophy</summary>

- Documentation deserves the same care as code. I version and test it like any other artifact.
- Modernizing legacy systems is a challenge I enjoy â€“ there's satisfaction in making old code new again.
- Code should deliver real value, so I approach problems with a product mindset.

<summary>Beyond the Keyboard</summary>

I'm bilingual (English/Spanish), a lifelong learner, and a fan of automating everyday tasks. You'll often find me experimenting with new tooling or helping teammates master their workflows.
