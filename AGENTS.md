# Agent Guidelines

This repo holds my GitHub profile README—a focused gateway into who I am and what I'm building.

## Intent
- Present a clear, minimal snapshot of my current focus: agentic workflows, AI CLI tooling, and developer environments.
- Avoid clutter. No decorative SVGs, contribution graphs, or badge walls.
- One featured project (Terminal Jarvis) with links; everything else lives in my portfolio.

## Style
- Center only the name and tagline; left-align the rest.
- Short blurb per section, then bullet points.
- Plain Markdown with minimal HTML (alignment only).
- Tone: confident but understated. Show, don't shout.

## Editing
- Keep updates atomic. One theme per commit.
- If adding a section, remove something else to preserve focus.
- Test links before pushing.
