# Agent Guidelines

Keep the profile minimal and readable, following the patterns established in the last two README refreshes:
- Center only the top name header and its short blurb; keep all other content left-aligned.
- Use a blurb followed by bullet points for each section to keep structure consistent.
- Highlight a single featured build with links; avoid adding extra projects or decorative assets.
- Prefer plain Markdown with light HTML only where alignment is needed, and remove unused SVGs or other clutter.
